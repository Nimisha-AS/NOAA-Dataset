# NOAA-Dataset

Logical Implementation:

* Import necessary libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium for mapping.
* Load the dataset: Read the CSV files into Pandas DataFrames and merge the two dataset into one for convenience.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert data types(datatype of date change from string to datetime), and remove leap days to prevent the seasonal variation that can be formed every four year.
* Data analysis: Filter, group, and calculate relevant statistics.
* Visualization: Created line graphs, scatter plots, bar plots and maps using appropriate plotting functions.
* Customization: Add labels, legends, titles, and formatting to enhance the visualizations.
* Output: Save the map as HTML files to reduce the file size.
